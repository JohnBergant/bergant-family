## 24 years with the love of my life

*You say you picked me, if that is the case then I must be the luckiest guy in the world. To be picked by such an intelligent, beautiful, strong, caring women...I really lucked out in the game of life. This past year has been one of the happiest times in my life.*

#### I see how well the girls are doing and how you handle their issues at school. It is so important to have such a caring, strong woman by their side.

#### I forsee great things for them in the future. You guided Evee through covid with our baby in your arms and I'm so proud of you both for coming out stronger

#### I love coaching with you! I was in awe the first practice with Wham!, I saw how easily you connected with the girls. It hit me hard, compared to what I've seen from others. I wish I had a coach like you as a kid.

#### I appreciate all that you do for us. I appreciate you listening to me about work after you have already had a very busy day battling with our girls, it means the world to me to talk to you at night, best part of my day bar none.

#### You have the ability to do anything you want with your life. I'm so glad you decided to share it with me
